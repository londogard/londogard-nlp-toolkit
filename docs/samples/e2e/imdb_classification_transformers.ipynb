The major point is we believe in those characters and once they&#39;ve met each other we want them to stay together. It&#39;s simple and really efficient. The background story is less important. Why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most French film-jerkers like to make. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l&#232;vres is only an entertaining French film with good characterization.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;For all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy. It goes quite as easy as in Rear Window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context. Where I am amazed it&#39;s to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if we&#39;ve not missed a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a new-comer yet.

In the time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters.

This movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child&#39;s imagination, okay thats all good and fine. But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. I mean come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this!! This is a move that I recommend NOT to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won&#39;t insult your intelligence! Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it&#39;s very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie.\\\">Anyone who actually had the ability t<span class=\\\"structural\\\">...</span></span>\",\"<span class=\\\"formatted\\\" title=\\\"One of the worst films I have ever seen.

Then there are a few more dreams in between. Come on, what is supposed to keep me interested in that? A film needs to have a reason to be interesting. The minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film-goer switches off. Ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them?
